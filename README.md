# Notifaye
## A notification system for the Vue Ecosystem (Vue + Vuex)
#### Notifaye provides a easy to use plugin for Vue that leverages the extensibility of the Vuex store and provides
#### the ability to create and manage dynamic and static notification queues.

#### The idea of this plugin is to be style / component agnostic.
#### There is the option to use the built in styling or components but the core function of the plugin
#### is to provide the underlying methods / structures and leave the styling / animation etc to the developer.

## Requirements

Required Packages
- Vue 2+
- Vuex

## Install

### Step 1)
```
npm install notifaye

```

### Step 2
Then import and utilise the plugin
#### Important Note
It is important to pass in the instance of your Vuex store next to notifaye in Vue.use() as Notifaye leverages it in the plugin.

```

import { notifaye } from 'Notifaye'

Vue.use(notifaye, store)

```

### Step 3
Finally add the plugin as a Vuex module. This allows Vuex to include our store as a namespaced substore (module) and gives it the ability to be accessed via Vuex normal store methods.

So, firstly import.
```

import { notifayeStore } from 'Notifaye'

```
And then register it as a module on the store object

```

modules: {
  notifaye: notifayeStore
},

```

### Features
